// Question 1

// The Data Detective
/*
In the charming village of JavaScriptville, a young detective named Max was known for solving mysterious data cases. One day, the villagers approached Max with an intriguing challenge. They had a magical box that could contain anything - numbers, strings, arrays, or even objects. However, the villagers were unsure about the contents inside the box.
Max's task was to determine the type of the input inside the magical box and report back with the result.

Example 1:
Input:
"4"
Output:
string

Example 2:
Input:
Hello, JavaScriptville!
Output:
string
*/

// Solution without function

// Example inputs

/*
let input1 = "4";
let input2 = "Hello, JavaScriptville!";
let input3 = 123;
let input4 = [1, 2, 3];
let input5 = {a: 1};
let input6 = true;
let input7 = null;
let input8 = undefined;

Determining the type using `typeof` directly

console.log(typeof input1); // Output: string
console.log(typeof input2); // Output: string
console.log(typeof input3); // Output: number
console.log(typeof input4); // Output: object
console.log(typeof input5); // Output: object
console.log(typeof input6); // Output: boolean
console.log(typeof input7); // Output: object (This is a quirk in JavaScript)
console.log(typeof input8); // Output: undefined
*/

// Explanation:
// typeof input1 returns "string" for the input "4".
// typeof input2 returns "string" for the input "Hello, JavaScriptville!".
// typeof input3 returns "number" for the input 123.
// typeof input4 returns "object" for the input array [1, 2, 3].
// typeof input5 returns "object" for the input object {a: 1}.
// typeof input6 returns "boolean" for the input true.
// typeof input7 returns "object" for the input null (a known quirk in JavaScript).
// typeof input8 returns "undefined" for the input undefined.
// This approach directly uses the typeof operator without encapsulating it in a function. You can apply this to any input to determine its type

// Solution with function

/*
function determineType(input) {
    return typeof input;
  }

Example usage:

  console.log(determineType("4")); // Output: string
  console.log(determineType("Hello, JavaScriptville!")); // Output: string
  console.log(determineType(123)); // Output: number
  console.log(determineType([1, 2, 3])); // Output: object (Arrays are considered objects in JavaScript)
  console.log(determineType({a: 1})); // Output: object
  console.log(determineType(true)); // Output: boolean
  console.log(determineType(null)); // Output: object (This is a quirk in JavaScript)
  console.log(determineType(undefined)); // Output: undefined
  */

//   Explanation:
//   typeof is the operator used to get the type of the input.
//   It correctly identifies strings, numbers, booleans, and undefined.
//   For arrays and objects, it will return "object".
//   Note: There is a known quirk in JavaScript where typeof null returns "object".

/*
Cleaning the String: The input string is cleaned by removing all non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase, similar to the previous approach.

Reversing the String: The cleaned string is reversed by splitting it into an array of characters, reversing the array, and then joining the characters back into a string.

Comparing Strings: The function checks if the cleaned original string is equal to the reversed string. If they are equal, the function returns true, indicating that the input string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns false.

/*
The Array Rotator

In the land of cyclical arrays, the people need a JavaScript function that can rotate an array by a given number of positions to the right. They seek to shift their array elements in a circular manner, enabling them to explore new possibilities with their data.
Write a JavaScript function called rotateArray that takes an array of integers and a positive integer k as inputs. The function should rotate the array k positions to the right.
Note: The value of k can be greater than the length of the array, so multiple rotations might be needed.

Example 1:
Input:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2

Output:

[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Example 2:

[7, 8, 9]

5

Output:
[ 8, 9, 7 ]
*/

// Solution

/*
function rotateArray(arr, k) {
  // Calculate the effective number of rotations
  const rotations = k % arr.length;

  // If there are no rotations needed, return the original array
  if (rotations === 0) {
    return arr;
  }

  // Split the array into two parts based on the number of rotations
  const rotatedPart = arr.splice(-rotations); // remove the last 'rotations' elements
  arr.unshift(...rotatedPart); // add the removed elements to the beginning of the array

  return arr;
}

// Example usage
const input1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k1 = 2;
const output1 = rotateArray(input1, k1);
console.log(output1); // Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

const input2 = [7, 8, 9];
const k2 = 5;
const output2 = rotateArray(input2, k2);
console.log(output2); // Output: [8, 9, 7]

/*
Calculate Effective Rotations: Similar to the previous implementation, calculate the effective number of rotations.

Handle No Rotations: If no rotations are needed, return the original array.

Split and Manipulate Array: Use splice to remove the last rotations elements from the array, and then use unshift along with the spread operator (...) to add the removed elements to the beginning of the array.

Return the Result: Return the rotated array.

/*
Explanation:

Initial Check: If the number is less than or equal to 1, it's not prime.
Loop to Check Divisors: We loop from 2 up to the square root of the number. The reason for going only up to the square root is that if n = a * b, then one of the factors (a or b) must be less than or equal to the square root of n. This reduces the number of iterations and makes the function more efficient.
Divisibility Check: Inside the loop, if the number is divisible by any of these values, it's not a prime number.
Return Result: If no divisors are found, the number is prime.
This method is efficient and works well for the purpose of checking prime numbers.

Explanation:

Filter Method: Use the filter method on the numbers array to create a new array that only contains elements equal to the target.
